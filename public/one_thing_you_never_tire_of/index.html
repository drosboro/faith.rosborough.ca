  <h1>One Thing You Never Tire Of</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Fri, Aug 7, 2015</span>
      <p>This morning, on my way to visit a friend, I was tuned into the local Christian radio station.  The hosts were encouraging people to call in and answer the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Name one thing you never get tired of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I listened, they read out some of the answers that listeners had called in: Starbucks.  Disneyland.  One listener said &ldquo;the laughter of children&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So, what do you never get tired of?</p>

<p>Interestingly, in the few minutes I listened, no one mentioned a <em>person</em>.  Not their kids (just their laughter), not their spouse, not their parents, not their significant other.  Perhaps because it&rsquo;s easy to get tired of people - we&rsquo;re not perfect.  I, for one, can be a bit annoying at times.  It&rsquo;s probably pretty tough to <em>not</em> get tired of me once in a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to say I was surprised that no one mentioned anything to do with God - but really, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much.  Church didn&rsquo;t come up.  Maybe that&rsquo;s because church is filled with <em>people</em>.  Jesus wasn&rsquo;t mentioned - maybe that would have been too spiritual.  The book of Leviticus wasn&rsquo;t high on the list.</p>

<p>King David may have actually been surprised by that last omission.  Psalm 119, after all, is essentially a love song to the Law of God.  Listen to some of the language David uses to describe the Law:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the way of your testimonies I delight as much as in all riches.  - Psalm 119:14</p>

<p>I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word.  - Psalm 119:16</p>

<p>My soul is consumed with longing for your rules at all times.  - Psalm 119:20</p>

<p>Your testimonies are my delight; they are my counselors.  - Psalm 119:24</p>

<p>I cling to your testimonies, O LORD; let me not be put to shame!  - Psalm 119:31</p>

<p>Lead me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in it.  - Psalm 119:35</p>

<p>Behold, I long for your precepts; in your righteousness give me life!  - Psalm 119:40</p>

<p>For I find my delight in your commandments, which I love.  I will lift up my hands toward your commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on your statutes.  - Psalm 119:47-48</p>

<p>Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight.  - Psalm 119:77</p>

<p>If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.  - Psalm 119:92</p>

<p>Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.  - Psalm 119:97</p>

<p>Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart.  - Psalm 119:111</p>

<p>Therefore I love your commandments above gold, above fine gold.  - Psalm 119:127</p>

<p>I open my mouth and pant, because I long for your commandments.  - Psalm 119:131</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He keeps going - but I think you get the idea.  Here is a man using the sort of language I <em>wish</em> I could think of to write in an anniversary card for my wife - and he&rsquo;s using it about Leviticus and Deuteronomy.  He <em>delights</em>, he <em>is consumed</em>, he <em>clings</em>, he <em>longs for</em>, he <em>loves</em>.</p>

<p>Why?  How?</p>

<p>As a teenager, I was stymied several times in my attempt to read through the Bible - mostly by these very passages that David is writing love songs about.  I didn&rsquo;t love them - they were <em>boring</em>.  Perhaps you might agree with me.  Maybe we harbour a suspicion that David is applying a bit of poetic license - maybe we think he&rsquo;s exaggerating just a little.  I mean, really - &ldquo;I open my mouth and pant, because I long for your commandments&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Given the content of the rest of David&rsquo;s written output, and the things written elsewhere about his life, it&rsquo;s a pretty tough argument to claim that he&rsquo;s just faking it.  We have no real reason to believe that he&rsquo;s lying, other than a sense of incredulousness arising from our own shortcomings.  But what motivates David&rsquo;s passion for the Word?</p>

<p>Look back through those verses I quoted above, and I think you&rsquo;ll see what it is.  Specifically, look for the word right <em>before</em> &ldquo;law&rdquo;, or &ldquo;testimonies&rdquo;, or &ldquo;statutes&rdquo;.  Each and every time, in these verses, it points to a <em>person</em>.  It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;the law&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;your law&rdquo;.  Not &ldquo;some testimonies&rdquo;, or &ldquo;those statutes&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s &ldquo;your testimonies&rdquo;, &ldquo;your statutes&rdquo;.  Behind the law is the giver of the Law.  David&rsquo;s longing, his desire, his love for God&rsquo;s Word stems from his love for God himself.  I have no interest in reading a letter written by someone I don&rsquo;t know - maybe a little if the author is famous, and I know <em>of</em> them a bit.  But show me a letter written to me by my wife, and you bet I want to read it - I may even keep it filed away and pull it out periodically to re-read it.  I love that letter, because <em>she</em> wrote it, and I love her.</p>

<p>I want to be like David.  I want my love for God to be so deep, so intense, so intentional that his Word becomes something I desire, something I am consumed with longing for, something I love.  Maybe I&rsquo;m not there yet.  I still struggle through some passages at times - I struggle to see the <em>person</em> behind the words as clearly as David did.</p>

<p>I really want to be the kind of person who, when asked &ldquo;Name one thing you never tire of&rdquo;, would be able to say with David:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart. - Psalm 119:111</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Lord, help me love your Word - but not just because of the words themselves.  Help me to love your Word because I love you.  Incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to selfish gain! Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways. (Psalm 119:36-37)  Amen.</em></p>
