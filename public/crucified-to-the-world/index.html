  <h1>Crucified to the World</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 12, 2008</span>
      <p>We had a visitor at church today, a guy who had never been there before. When I was talking to him between services, he was telling us how much God had been doing for him and working in his life. Then he gave us a specific example - it turned out that last night he slept outside our local bank, under the awning, after getting ditched by some friends miles away from the shelter where he could have had a bed for the night. It got down to about -15°C last night (with the wind-chill), so it was a pretty serious situation. When he woke up this morning, he found himself covered in a blanket. If someone hadn&rsquo;t put that blanket on him last night, he might just not have woke up, period.</p>

<p>I sat there about 3 feet away from this guy, this morning, using my 32gb iPod Touch to find the passage that the preacher was on. Now, I&rsquo;ve been preaching at my students lately about my iPod Touch, and how it represents my own selfishness, my me-first consumerism, my &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo; to the world&rsquo;s view of things. I&rsquo;ve been comparing it to the BMW that Tony Campolo talked about way back when, when he said he didn&rsquo;t figure Jesus would have a BMW in his driveway as long as there were poor people in Haiti (or, for that matter, in the seats in my church). For me, I drive a &lsquo;93 Civic, so I felt pretty good about myself until I thought about that 32gb iPod Touch that I&rsquo;d recently bought. When I bought it, I stood in the Costco for a good 15 minutes, trying to come up with a reasonable justification why I needed not just an iPod Touch, but the 32gb version. The thing cost me about $500.</p>

<p>The preacher this morning was preaching from the end of Galatians. He got to this passage this morning, which I finally dug up on my iPod Touch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.</p>

<p>Galatians 6:14-15</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I sat there, feeling rather uncomfortable. What does it mean to be crucified to the world? What does it mean to be a new creation? Is there anything about me that <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> shout &ldquo;I love the world!&rdquo;, but rather says &ldquo;I love God&rdquo;? Does my willingness to rush out and drop $500 on an electronic gadget that I really don&rsquo;t need at all, while a guy sleeps outside the bank 2 blocks from my house, nearly freezing to death, say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a new creation&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I think if the &ldquo;world has been crucified to me&rdquo;, my attitude about the things of the world, the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, the &ldquo;lust of the flesh&rdquo;, the &ldquo;pride of life&rdquo;, ought to be different than the attitudes of those who are &ldquo;of the world&rdquo;. Why is it that, so often, and perhaps most obviously around Christmas time, we let ourselves become enthralled with things?</p>
