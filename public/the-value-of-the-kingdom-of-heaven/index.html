  <h1>The Value of the Kingdom of Heaven</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 8, 2011</span>
      <p>What matters to you? If you asked me what matters most in life, I would <em>tell</em> you that the most important thing in my life is God. But would you see that from the way I live? If, instead of asking, you just watched me carefully, observed what I spend my time doing, you&rsquo;d probably think that my job, my kids, my wife, and food are what really matter to me.</p>

<p>Matthew 13:44-46 says:
&gt; “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
&gt; “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.</p>

<p>The two men in these parables not only <em>knew</em> that they had found something of incredible value, they realized that it was worth so much more than everything else they had - and then they acted on it.</p>
