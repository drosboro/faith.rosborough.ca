    This morning, on my way to visit a friend, I was tuned into the local Christian radio station. The hosts were encouraging people to call in and answer the following question: Name one thing you never get tired of. While I listened, they read out some of the answers that listeners had called in: Starbucks. Disneyland. One listener said &ldquo;the laughter of children&rdquo;. So, what do you never get tired of?

    <p>I had a student recently ask, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you sad that there&rsquo;s so many things in the world, and we can&rsquo;t be an expert on all of them?&rdquo;  Her frustration was stemming (I think) from her uncertainty about her future career path, and her interest in too many things.</p>

<p>Actually, I think it&rsquo;s precisely that problem that makes life interesting.  It&rsquo;s why, after thirty-some years, I&rsquo;m still not really a &ldquo;know-it-all&rdquo;, even if I&rsquo;d like to think so.  It&rsquo;s why I can still sit down at my computer to learn something about home repair, something about computer science, something about biology, something about God.</p>

    <p>What matters to you? If you asked me what matters most in life, I would <em>tell</em> you that the most important thing in my life is God. But would you see that from the way I live? If, instead of asking, you just watched me carefully, observed what I spend my time doing, you&rsquo;d probably think that my job, my kids, my wife, and food are what really matter to me.</p>

    <p>I was recently co-leading a Bible study for teen workers at <a href="http://www.morningstarbiblecamp.com">Morning Star Bible Camp</a>. It was a great opportunity to stop and think about what&rsquo;s really important in the Christian life. We decided to focus on discipleship - which, of course, is a pretty broad topic. One of the discussions we had was around counting the cost of being a disciple.</p>

    <p>I got reading a bit of Seneca’s <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life">On the Shortness of Life</a> this afternoon. Seneca was a Stoic philosopher, meaning that he belonged to a camp that “preached freedom from passion by following reason” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>Seneca’s main point is that it’s pointless to complain about how short life is. Life, he says, is plenty long enough; the main problem is that we waste most of it.</p>

    <p>We had a visitor at church today, a guy who had never been there before. When I was talking to him between services, he was telling us how much God had been doing for him and working in his life. Then he gave us a specific example - it turned out that last night he slept outside our local bank, under the awning, after getting ditched by some friends miles away from the shelter where he could have had a bed for the night. It got down to about -15°C last night (with the wind-chill), so it was a pretty serious situation. When he woke up this morning, he found himself covered in a blanket. If someone hadn&rsquo;t put that blanket on him last night, he might just not have woke up, period.</p>
