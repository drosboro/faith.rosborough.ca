What matters to you? If you asked me what matters most in life, I would _tell_ you that the most important thing in my life is God. But would you see that from the way I live? If, instead of asking, you just watched me carefully, observed what I spend my time doing, you'd probably think that my job, my kids, my wife, and food are what really matter to me.

Matthew 13:44-46 says:
> “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
> “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.

The two men in these parables not only _knew_ that they had found something of incredible value, they realized that it was worth so much more than everything else they had - and then they acted on it.
